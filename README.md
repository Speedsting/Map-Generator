# Map-Generator
Creates a login window for old users to sign in or new users to create 
accounts. Signed in users can either see their previously submitted classes on 
the school schedule based on the day, while newer users will have to add their 
classes manually. Generates a map of the school that is supposed to draw lines
going from class to class

Current working version: 3.7.0

Patch Notes: Added stairways for lines to direct user to, 

Errors: Lines are not completely accurate and are unable to detect hallways, error is
given when the user enters their username and password to sign in.
